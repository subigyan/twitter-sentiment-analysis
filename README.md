# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Tweets

The project is a sentiment analysis of twitter tweets. It uses a naive bayes classifier to classify the tweets as positive or negative. We train the classifier on a dataset of tweets that are already classified as positive or negative. The classifier is then used to classify the tweets in the test dataset. The accuracy of the classifier is then calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels in the test dataset.
